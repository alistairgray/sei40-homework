<h2>Index of Planets</h2>

<ul>
  <% @planets.each do |p| %>
    <li>
      <!--  Instead of directly using a RUL plike '/planets/9'. Rails encourages you to use a helper method which will give you the URL, based on what is in your routes.rb file; this is supposed to dry up your templates -->

      <%= link_to p.name, planet_path(p.id) %>
    </li>
