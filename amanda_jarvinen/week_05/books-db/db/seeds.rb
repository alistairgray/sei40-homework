    author: 'Robert A. Heinlein',
    description: "In 2075, the Moon is no longer a penal colony. But it is still a prison...  Life isn't easy for the political dissidents and convicts who live in the scattered colonies that make up lunar civilisation. Everything is regulated strictly, efficiently and cheaply by a central supercomputer, HOLMES IV.
    
    When humble technician Mannie O'Kelly-Davis discovers that HOLMES IV has quietly achieved consciousness (and developed a sense of humour), the choice is clear: either report the problem to the authorities... or become friends.
    
    And perhaps overthrow the government while they're at it.",
