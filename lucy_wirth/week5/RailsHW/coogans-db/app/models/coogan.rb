  # This model file will tell ActiveRecord where to find your
  # database table - it uses the pluralised lowercase version
  # of the class name

  # Later on, we will also specify our associations here
  # such as 'has_many :movies' etc

  # Much later on, you can also define your own methods here
  # to specify the business logic for this model
